I also tested Ubuntu Server 20.04.3 LTS 8
Use Ubuntu Server if you prefer a command-line interface, it will save you some system resources.
Host PC Specs:
OS: Windows 11 Home (21H2)
Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics 3.20 GHz
Ram: 16.0 GB (15.3 GB usable) I recommend having 32gb, I just ordered more.
VirtualBox Settings:
Type: Linux
Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
Base Memory: 10,700MB (Will be upgrading soon - Works fine for small projects currently)
Processor(s): 8
Virtualization Interface: Default
Video Memory: 128MB
Graphics Controller: VMSVGA
Acceleration: None
Storage: 120gb-Fixed Size-VDI (Can be expanded later)
Network Adaptor: Bridged Adaptor
Under “Network>Advanced” Select: Allow VMs
Once you have the VM settings complete you can add your “OS.iso” of choice. In this case lubuntu or Ubuntu. Open the settings of the VM, select “Storage” Under “Controller: IDE” you should see a CD icon that says “Empty”. Click that and then click on the CD icon with the small down arrow on the right side. A menu will pop up, select “Choose a disk file…” Navigate to your downloaded “OS.iso” select it, and click “Open”.
Once that is done you can start the VM, It will act mostly like a regular computer with a bootable CD in it at this point. Run through the prompts to install the OS.
After that is installed and you are booted into the VM you can install WebODM!
1. Open a terminal
2. Type:
$ sudo apt update
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sh get-docker.sh
$ sudo apt install -y git python python3-pip
$ sudo pip install docker-compose
3. Check that Docker Compose is working:
$ docker-compose --version
Should display something like this “docker-compose version 1.22.0”
4. Download WebODM
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/webodm
$ cd webodm
$ ./webodm.sh start
Now WebODM should be running on your VM! You can access it from the IP address of the VM, type the IP address in your host PCs web browser.
I recommend manually assigning the VM IP around the DHCP server on your home router. This process will vary from different brands of routers. But assigning your VMs MAC address to an IP will keep the address from changing and make it so you can keep accessing the WebODM page on the same URL every time.
Trouble finding your VM IP?
1. Open a terminal and type
$ sudo apt install net-tools
$ ifconfig
That will display a line of text something like this:
inet 192.168.50.198 “<–This is your IP” netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.50.255
I hope this was informative or helpful in some way. I’m not the best at explaining things.
I also have my server running on port 80 with SSL and using a custom subdomain from my domain that is registered with NameCheap. I might make a short topic on that in the future.
Let me know if you have any questions!

ssh osboxes@192.168.1.90/

Try purging before install:
sudo apt-get purge openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

apt install virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11

To enable HTTP on Ubuntu 22.04, you can install and configure the Apache web server:

Update the package indexes: sudo apt update
Install Apache: sudo apt install apache2
Restart the system
Start the Apache service: sudo systemctl start apache2
Set Apache to start at boot: sudo systemctl enable apache2
Check the status of the Apache service: service apache2 status

We need to create a non-root user with sudo privileges. This ensures a higher level of security and safety rather than logging in as root user all the time, which is potentially dangerous.
I’ll create a new user named richie, but you can use your name or almost any name you like (some usernames are reserved for system accounts):
adduser richie
You will be asked the following questions and you will need to enter and confirm a new password. If you don’t want to answer the rest, just keep pressing the ENTER key:
	• New Password – [mynewpassword]
	• Confirm Password – [mynewpassword]
	• Full Name
	• Room Number
	• Work Phone
	• Home Phone
	• Other
	• Is the information correct? – Y
Now let’s give your new user sudo privileges so you can run commands normally reserved for root (replace my username richie with yours):
usermod -aG sudo richie
Now if you need to run root commands as your new user, prepend them with sudo and you’ll be prompted to enter your new users password (not root password).
